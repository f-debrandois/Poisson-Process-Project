# 📈 Nonhomogeneous Poisson Process (NHPP) Analysis  

This project investigates methods for detecting increasing trends in **Nonhomogeneous Poisson Processes (NHPPs)**. It provides a theoretical and practical analysis of statistical tests, including the **Laplace test** and **Boswell’s likelihood ratio test**, through simulations and real-world applications.  

## 📖 Description  

A **Nonhomogeneous Poisson Process (NHPP)** is used to model event occurrences where the rate (intensity function **λ(t)**) varies over time. Understanding this rate is crucial in fields such as:  
- 🔧 **Reliability Engineering** (e.g., monitoring system deterioration)  
- 🏥 **Healthcare** (e.g., analyzing disease outbreak trends)  
- 🌍 **Environmental Studies** (e.g., detecting climate-related event escalation)  

This study was inspired by the work of **Bain, Engelhardt, and Wright**, whose approaches to detecting increasing trends in NHPPs lack clarity in both theoretical explanation and practical application. To address these gaps, the project explores the **Laplace test** and **Boswell’s likelihood ratio test**, evaluating their effectiveness through numerical simulations and real-world data analysis.
